# What is this Repository?

1. **Demo of how the code can be reused between React and React Native Application**
2. **Extracts the business logic to a seperate npm package**
3. **Uses Redux to write application business logic**: Actions and Reducers are extracted to a seperate npm package.


# Code Structure
1. **web**: A web application created using Create React App
2. **mobile**: Mobile app created using React Native cli
3. **core**: The npm package which contains extracted business logic(Actions, Reducers etc). This is reused in both web and mobile

# How to use
1. `npm install` and `npm link` in Core
2. `npm install` and `npm link core` in Web and Mobile
